# Simons-Game

The Simon game is a simple memory game where players must repeat a random sequence of lights by pressing the coloured buttons in the correct order.
The number counter on the left keeps your highest score, while the number on the right is your current score. While the game is in play mode the indicator is green, 
otherwise it is red. If the player incorrectly guesses or takes too long all 4 buttons flash simultaneously 5 times and the game ends. 
After the 5th, 9th and 13th	rounds, the game automatically speeds up the interval between signals.
